    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 42;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 69;
    console.log(age, age2) // updating the original doesn't affect the age2 copy of age
    // same principle applies to strings

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team.push("Scott");
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log({ players, team});
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const playersCopy = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const playersCopy2 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const playersCopy3 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    playersCopy.push("New Player");
    playersCopy2.push("New Player 2");
    playersCopy3.push("New Player 3");

    console.log({ players, team, playersCopy, playersCopy2, playersCopy3 });

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});
    console.log(person, cap);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread soon means now
    cap2 = {...person};
    cap2.hair = "long";
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
